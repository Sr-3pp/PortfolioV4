Frontend-focused Full-Stack developer with 10+ years of experience building production-grade web applications. Certified Senior Vue Developer with deep expertise in Vue, Nuxt, and modern frontend architecture across enterprise and consumer products.

I specialize in designing and leading scalable frontend systems: component libraries, design systems, dynamic page architectures, and high-performance SSR applications. My work spans industries such as banking, travel, and e-commerce, where reliability, accessibility, and performance are critical.

In enterprise environments, I’ve led UI architecture and component strategies for large-scale platforms, helping teams ship consistent, maintainable interfaces across complex product ecosystems. In smaller teams and startups, I’ve taken full-stack ownership—building APIs, integrating payments, optimizing data pipelines, and delivering complete production systems.

Beyond client work, I run my own skateboarding brand, where I design, build, and ship both the digital platform and physical products. This hands-on experience keeps me close to real users and reinforces a strong product mindset.

I enjoy collaborating with designers, PMs, and engineers to turn product ideas into fast, accessible, and maintainable interfaces. Whether leading a design system, building a Nuxt SSR platform, or mentoring a team, my focus is always on shipping clean, modular solutions that scale.
