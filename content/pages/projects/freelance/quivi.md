  <Card title="Overview">
    <div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
      <p>Developed a large‑scale autoparts e‑commerce platform, initially built with Nuxt 2 and Django REST, and later re‑architected into a Nuxt‑centric stack to simplify deployments, reduce backend complexity, and accelerate feature delivery. The platform handled high‑volume catalogs, complex fitment logic, and frequent content updates.</p>
